One of the conversations I dread the most with friends and family is when a
computer breaks or is stolen and the data is gone.

CrashPlan is a great unlimited online backup service. All of your files are
encrypted and backed up. I've been using it since 2008 and CrashPlan has saved
every single edit I've made to files during that time.

The backup client installs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. They are truly an
unlimited backup without any tricks. The cost works out to be about $5 per
month if paid annually.

Your data is important. With viruses, ransomware, hardware failure, and all the
other risks out there, don't risk it. Just get CrashPlan.

Additionally, you should be backing up your photos to [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/), which
provides unlimited free backup for pictures up to 18 megapixel and for videos up to 1080p.

I don't recommend Flickr. Flickr offers 1TB for free, but the interface is
clunky and videos aren't free. Google Photos has unlimited photos and video, so
it makes more sense to go with them. If you have high resolution photos and
videos that exceed the free tier, then it would make sense to back those up to
CrashPlan and let Google Photos store a reduced-quality version for free.

Amazon allows Prime members to store unlimited photos and videos. But the web
interface is clunky and the desktop uploader is pretty bad too. I do backup
about 340 GB of photos and videos to Amazon for free using
[Rclone](http://rclone.org/). If you can use Rclone, I recommend using Amazon
(as an additional backup, in addition to Google Photos). Otherwise, just to
Google Photos.
