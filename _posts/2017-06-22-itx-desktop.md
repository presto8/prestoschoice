Last year, I built a mid-sized desktop gaming system. I've been really pleased
with it so far and it gets a lot of use in our family.

But the case is unnecessarily large for our needs: we only have one graphics
card and don't use any drive bays. So when it came time to build another
system, I decided to investigate smaller form factor systems.

Here is my current recommendation if size is a principal concern.

| Category     | Product                                                                                               | Price |
| Case         | [Riotoro CR1080](http://amzn.to/2bhfQDs)                                                              | $80   |
| Motherboard  | [Gigabyte Z170X-Ultra Gaming](http://amzn.to/2iNB7Xj)                                                 | $148  |
| Power supply | [Corsair CX450M](http://amzn.to/2bGUUa0)                                                              | $50   |
| CPU          | [Intel Core i7-6700K](http://amzn.to/2bCu6bZ)                                                         | $320  |
| CPU Fan      | [DeepCool Captain 120 EX](http://amzn.to/2cugXP7)                                                     | $65   |
| GPU          | [Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti OC](http://amzn.to/2hU4OaQ)                                             | $145  |
| Memory       | [Avexir Core Series 2x8GB DDR4-2400](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820011180) | $70   |
| Hard disk    | [Intel 600p Series 256GB M.2 SSD](http://amzn.to/2cuhBfs)                                             | $107  |
| Mouse        | [Logitech G602 Gaming Wireless Mouse](http://amzn.to/2iNDrO7)                                         | $50   |

[Riotoro CR1080](http://amzn.to/2bhfQDs): This is a really great case. It is
the most compact case I could find that allows an ATX motherboard. It has a
two-sided design where the power supply and hard disks go on one side and the
motherboard goes on the other. To use this case, you will probably need to use
liquid cooling as there is not much height inside the case for most of the air
coolers. Riotoro has excellent customer service; I emailed them a fairly
detailed question and they responded within 1 business day with all of the
information I needed. Overall, highly recommended case, especially for the
price.

[Intel 600p Series 256GB M.2 SSD](http://amzn.to/2cuhBfs): M.2 with x4 PCI
Express is the only way to go for hard disk storage. Make sure the motherboard
supports this and then get whatever size SSD you feel you need. The Intel 600p
has pretty good performance for the price point. The [Samsung 950 Pro Series](http://amzn.to/2cuiAMr) has better performance but costs 50% more.

[DeepCool Captain 120 EX](http://amzn.to/2cugXP7): I got this cooler because it
has a cool pulsing red color and an awesome steam-punk style tube. Frankly, all
of these coolers seem more or less the same, but this one had good reviews for
easy installation, good cooling power, and high quality construction. I contacted
customer support with some questions and they responded within 1 business day.
3 year warranty. I also considered the [Corsair H60](http://amzn.to/2czl1gN)
and the [Thermaltake Water 3.0 Performance C](http://amzn.to/2czlj7G). All of
these are 120mm fans, which is the biggest size that will comfortably fit in
the Riotoro case. It should be more than enough cooling power. If I need more,
I can run two fans in push-pull configuration.

A note on price: I linked Amazon out of convenience (because that is the
default vendor for Presto's Choice), but often Newegg has better prices.
