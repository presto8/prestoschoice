I have a bit of a headlamp addiction. I own four now.

My current overall recommendation is the Black Diamond Spot. The Spot has been
redesigned several times, be sure to get the 200 lumen version. This is a
compact, very bright headlamp. 

The Black Diamond ReVolt is often compared to the Spot and has rechargeable
batteries, but it is bulkier than the Spot and less water resistant. It is also
brighter by 20% if you use alkaline batteries instead of the rechargeables. But
if you use a headlamp a lot, then this would be a good choice.

The Petzl Tikkina is what I bought for my kids. I picked it up for $15
(batteries included) on sale at REI. It is a simple but powerful headlamp.
