I have a bit of a headlamp addiction. I own four now: Petzl Tikka Pro, Black
Diamond Spot, Coast HL7, and Petzl Tikkina (for the kids).

My current overall recommendation is the [Black Diamond Spot](http://amzn.to/2ccDPE8). 
The Spot has been redesigned several times, be sure to get the 200 lumen
version. This is a compact, very bright headlamp. It's waterproof (IPX8). It
has a red LED mode (for preserving night vision). And it has a lock to prevent
accidental activation in your pack. It's your best bet if you only want to own
one headlamp.

The [Coast HL7](http://amzn.to/2cloSgG) is an incredible headlamp. It is
extremely bright (285 lumens).  It's the easiest to use of all the headlamps I
own. But it's not waterproof, some people may not like the battery box on the
back (it doesn't bug me), and battery life is short when the brightness is
turned up.

The Black Diamond ReVolt is often compared to the Spot and has rechargeable
batteries, but it is bulkier than the Spot and less water resistant. It is also
brighter by 20% if you use alkaline batteries instead of the rechargeables. But
if you use a headlamp a lot, then this would be a good choice.

The Petzl Tikkina is what I bought for my kids. I picked it up for $15
(batteries included) on sale at REI. It is a simple but powerful headlamp.
