Moving into a house, I quickly realized I would need a leaf blower. Many of
my friends tried to talk me into a gas blower. But I didn't want to deal with
the mess and hassle of gas and oil. Plus, gas blowers aren't that great for the
environment and they are really noisy.

I took a chance on the EGO cordless leaf blower. It is incredibly powerful and lasts long enough for me to blow all of my decks, sidewalks, and driveways, several times over.
