If you go camping, you will see these Coleman stoves everywhere. There are two
similar models, one comes with an auto-ignition feature. The one I bought
requires you to provide your own lighter. Many reviews say that the
auto-ignition feature becomes tempermental after a while. And it is quite easy
to light this stove with matches or a lighter; so I went for the cheaper model.

I don't camp that often (a few trips a year), so I can't justify paying more
for a nicer stove. But if you want a nicer one, the [Camp Chef Mountain
Series](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Camping-Stove-Reviews/Camp-Chef-Everest)
comes highly rated (around $100).

The Camp Chef is supposedly twice as hot (although that means twice as much
fuel), but to me the Coleman seems quite hot already. Unless you are boiling
water, you won't have it anywhere near the top temperature. And even if you are
boiling water, the Coleman will get it done reasonably quickly.
