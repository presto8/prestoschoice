If you go camping, you will see these Coleman stoves everywhere. There are two
similar models, one comes with an auto-ignition feature. The one I bought
requires you to provide your own lighter.

I don't camp that often (a few trips a year), so I can't justify paying more
for a nicer stove. But if you want a nicer one, the [Camp Chef Mountain
Series](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Camping-Stove-Reviews/Camp-Chef-Everest)
comes highly rated (around $100).
