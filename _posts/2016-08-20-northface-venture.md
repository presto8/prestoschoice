The [Outdoor Gear Lab
review](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Rain-Jacket-Reviews) of rain jackets is
the best I've seen. The North Face Venture doesn't fare well in their review,
but I personally can vouch for it. I also think the Patagonia Torrentshell is a
great jacket if you can get it for a good price (and Patagonia is known for
killer sales of up to 50% off).

At around 11 ounces total weight for the Venture, it's 

Another great jacket which I own is the [Marmot Minimalist]. It's authentic
Gore-Tex and a little sturdier than the Venture. The chest pocket is really nice.
