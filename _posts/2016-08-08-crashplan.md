One of the conversations I dread the most with friends and family is when a
computer breaks or is stolen and the data is gone.

CrashPlan is a great unlimited online backup service. All of your files are
encrypted and backed up. I've been using it since 2008 and CrashPlan has saved
every single edit I've made to files during that time.

The backup client installs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. They are truly an
unlimited backup without any tricks. The cost works out to be about $5 per
month if paid annually.

Your data is important. With viruses, ransomware, hardware failure, and all the
other risks out there, don't risk it. Just get CrashPlan.
