I bought these to put in plastic storage tubs to keep things dry. 

These are really nice because they change color from blue (active) to pink
(used up). When they are used up, they can be recharged by baking them in the
kitchen oven.

Each silica packet can keep dry 1300 cubic inches or 0.75 cubic feet.

I use 3 packets for a 17 gallon storage tub and 5 packets for a 27 gallon
storage tub.
