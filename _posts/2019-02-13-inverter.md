Abstract
========

Discusses how to design and build a multi-day emergency power solution, utilizing gas generators, lead-acid batteries, and power inverters.


Motivation
==========

Multi-day power outages, especially in the winter, can provide many challenges:
lighting, heating, bathing, food preparation and storage (especially frozen
items), communications, and boredom.


Review of available solutions
=============================
(It's safe to skip this section if you want to get straight to the recommendation)

Many options are available however cost is usually the main factor for most households.

Whole house standby generators powered by natural gas will provide automatic
failover. These require professional electrician installation as well as a
natural gas meter upgrade. The systems may require annual maintenance. The
natural gas pipes may rupture in a seismic event, defeating the entire
solution. Lastly, the cost is prohibitive for many at $15,000 or more.

Gas or propane generators are relatively inexpensive for the amount of power
they provide. Propane fuel is shelf-stable and readily available. Gas requires
treatment for storage and even then has a maximum shelf life of 2 years.
Generators require ventilation and must be run outside. Generators are quite
loud. Unused fuel should not be left in a generator. Generators produce power
by using an engine to turn an alternator that produces AC power. Unfortunately
the power produced is “rougher” than AC power from the power company, which may
cause problems for sensitive electronic devices.

Inverter generators are similar to regular generators but they solve two
problems: noise and AC power quality. Inverter generators are usually much
quieter than normal generators. Inverter generators produce power in a similar
way to regular generators, but they add an additional step where the AC power
is converted to DC and then back to AC again, which produces much cleaner AC
power. The downside to inverter generators is that they are substantially more
expensive than regular generators.


Minimum Recommended Solution
============================

I purchased all of these items from Amazon. The items often do go on sale or
can be purchased from Amazon Warehouse Deals for a substantial savings.

12V lead acid battery
---------------------

You will need a battery that can store a lot of energy. I recommend that
everybody start out with a 100Ah battery like the [Universal
UB121000](https://amzn.to/2N3NUUK) (I paid $168). This battery was able to
power by 30-year-old refrigerator for almost 24 hours.

If after setting up the system and doing a practice run, you decide that you
need more power, then you can purchase additional batteries and connect them
together.

Inverter
--------

For most people, I recommend getting a 1500W inverter such as the [VertaMax
Pure Sine Wave 1500](https://amzn.to/2BzfVih).

This will be powerful enough to power a microwave oven for short amounts of
time should you need to do that. It should be able to easily handle most
household needs, such as refrigerators, Internet routers, laptop and phone
chargers, etc.

Unlike many other inverters, this one comes with the proper cables, connecting
hardware, and fuses that you need.

It is possible to order a smaller or larger inverter, but you will need to
calculate your exact power needs. The easiest way is to check this [list of
energy
amps](https://www.metrosolarmatics.com/applliance-wattsamps-calculator.html).
For example, a TV is listed at 100W. Divide the total watts by 10 and that will
give the approximate number of battery amps used per hour. If you are using the
100Ah battery recommended above, a 100W TV would pull 10A and thus the battery
would last for 10 hours.
