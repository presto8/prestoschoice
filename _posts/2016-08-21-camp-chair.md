{:.summary}

This camp chair weighs less than 2 pounds. With a family of four with four
chairs to lug, this compares quite favorably to the standard inexpesnive camp
chair weight of over 10 pounds.

This chair is half the price of the equivalent chair at REI, the [REI Flex
Lite](https://www.rei.com/product/877258/rei-flex-lite-chair). The superlight
camp chair seems to have been pioneered by the
[Helinox](http://amzn.to/2bGIWtW), which is the one to get if you don't care
about price.

But I think the [Moon Lence](http://amzn.to/2bbsYd6) is almost as good for a lot less money.
