I was pretty sure I wanted an electric pressure washer. I didn't want to deal
with the maintenance, noise, and messiness of gas.

The Sun Joe has wn induction motor, mostly metal parts where it counts, and a
2-year warranty. At this price point, these factors really set it apart from
the competition.

Sun Joe has an upgraded model, the [http://amzn.to/2fFO6Yy](Sun Joe SPX3001),
that adds a hose reel. But I don't think it justifies the higher cost. And a
lot of people complain that the hose reel breaks or isn't that useful.
