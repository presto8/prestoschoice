I decided that I didn't need a 4k monitor; the difference isn't really
noticeable from a few feet back and many current PCs don't support 4k.

My wish list for a PC monitor includes:

* IPS panel
* 2560x1440 minimum resolution

It has really good reviews: [TFT Central](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/dell_u2515h.htm).

The U2515H has an excellent 3-year warranty and the "Premium Panel Guarantee"
will replace the monitor if it has a single stuck bright pixel. The U2515H is
one of the only monitors that is factory calibrated for color correctness.
