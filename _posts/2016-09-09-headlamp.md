I have a bit of a headlamp addiction. I own five now: Petzl Tikka XP, Black
Diamond Spot, Coast HL7, Petzl Tikkina (for the kids), and Petzl e+LITE
(ultrasmall for backup and emergencies).

My current overall recommendation is the [Black Diamond Spot](http://amzn.to/2ccDPE8). 
The Spot has been redesigned several times, be sure to get the 200 lumen
version. This is a compact, very bright headlamp. It's waterproof (IPX8). It
has a red LED mode (for preserving night vision). And it has a lock to prevent
accidental activation in your pack. It's your best bet if you only want to own
one headlamp.

The [Coast HL7](http://amzn.to/2cloSgG) is an incredible headlamp. It is
extremely bright (285 lumens).  It's the easiest to use of all the headlamps I
own. But it's not waterproof, some people may not like the battery box on the
back (it doesn't bug me), and battery life is short when the brightness is
turned up. But this one's great for projects around the house.

[Petzl Tikkina](http://amzn.to/2cud26U) is a nice basic headlamp. It has Petzl
quality, one button, and two brightness levels (max 80 lumens). It should be
fairly water resistant. I think it's a good basic headlamp for kids, but adults
should get the Spot.

The [Black Diamond ReVolt](http://amzn.to/2c8OIZo) is often compared to the
Spot. It has rechargeable batteries (and can also use regular batteries). But
it's more expensive than the Spot, not waterproof, and not as bright (max 100
lumens with rechargeable batteries). I would only get this if you really use the headlamp a lot and don't have a standalone battery charger.

The [Petzl e+LITE](http://amzn.to/2cuj5oE) is a really specialized headlamp. I
carry it as a backup just in case my primary headlamp doesn't work for whatever
reason. It's very small and has a 10-year shelf life.
