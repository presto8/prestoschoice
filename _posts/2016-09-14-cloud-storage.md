There are a lot of cloud storage options today. I have reviewed all of the
options and the Presto's Choice is Google Drive. It has the best overall
balance for all users.

Google Drive at $2/month for up to 100 GB is a great deal. If you buy a
Chromebook, like the [Presto's Choice Acer](/chromebook), it may come with 2 years of 100 GB
storage for free. If you need more storage, 1TB is $10/month. I think these
prices will likely come down over time as well.

Google Drive allows you to store photos up to 16 megapixels and videos up to
1080p for free (they don't count against your storage quota). If you install
the Google Photos app on your smartphone, it will automatically backup any
photos you take.

Note that the photos have to be uploaded via the Google Photos interface and
not via Google Drive. If you upload photos via Google Drive, they will always
count against your quota. Also, Google does change the photos a little bit;
most users won't notice the difference, but if that is important for you, see
the recommendation for photo enthusiasts below.

While we are on the topic of photos, Google's online photo editing tools are
simply amazing. You can edit photos, automatically identify faces, search for
themes like "Christmas", and more. People looking to simplify their photo
processing workload should look no further than Google Photos.

One feature that Google Drive has that nobody else has is [file versions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2409045?hl=en). File
versioning is very important since it allows you to go back to a period in time
and recover a file's contents at that moment in time. Backup software like the
[Presto's Choice CrashPlan](/crashplan) automatically do that, but most cloud storage
services do not offer this. Note that file versioning is turned off by default
on Google Drive and must be manually enabled.

For photo enthusiasts who have raw files or who don't want Google compressing
their pictures, unfortunately it is just not that easy. My assumption is that a
photo enthusiast will want to keep a full copy of all photos on a local hard
disk and is only concerned with backup and sharing photos. For backup, I would
recommend the [Presto's Choice Crashplan](/crashplan). And for sharing photos, just use
whatever social platform you like (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Flickr,
etc.).

For photo enthusiasts who don't want to spend any additional money and are also
Amazon Prime members, and also are Linux nerds, I would recommend backing up
your photos to Amazon Cloud for free. Amazon includes raw photo files in its
free photo program. [Rclone](http://rclone.org/) is a great program to sync
your photos easily to Amazon Cloud.
