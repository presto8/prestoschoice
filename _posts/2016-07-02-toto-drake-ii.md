Toilets are something that are rarely replaced, so it's one of the products
that makes sense to invest.

Toto has a great reputation for toilet quality. Their newer toilets are known
for being virtually clog proof. Toto helped pioneer the low-volume water toilet
and their design is superior to many others.

Styling is in the eye of the beholder, but I like the way the Drake II looks.

Toto toilets come with the option of Sanigloss, which is a coating that Toto
says will make it easier to keep your toilet clean.

The Drake II comes only in "universal height", which is what you want anyway.
It just means that the toilet is higher. It is much more comfortable to sit on
a high toilet. Don't worry if you have kids, my 2-year-old has no problem
getting up on the Drake II all by himself.

Like all two-piece toilets, the Drake II does not come with a toilet seat.
Either get the [Presto's Choice C200 Washlet]() or order the matching Toto
soft-close toilet seat, the [Toto SS114 SoftClose Elongated Toilet Seat Cover](http://amzn.to/2bfP3rX).
