I was pretty sure I wanted an electric pressure washer. I didn't want to deal
with the maintenance, noise, and messiness of gas. I also wanted it to be
fairly light since I have to haul it around our house for cleaning decks and
sidewalks.

The [Sun Joe SPX3000](http://amzn.to/2fFRkuU) has an induction motor, mostly
metal parts where it counts, and a 2-year warranty. At this price point, these
factors really set it apart from the competition.

I thought long and hard about whether to get a hose reel, which the 
[Sun Joe SPX3001](http://amzn.to/2fFO6Yy) has.  But I don't think it justifies the
higher cost. And a lot of people complain that the hose reel breaks or isn't
that useful.

I also considered the [Greenworks GPW1951](http://amzn.to/2fUIoqr)
(highly rated by Consumer Reports), [AR Blue Clean AR390SS](http://amzn.to/2fFSuXq) (recommended by my friend who owns a pressure washing business), and
[Karcher K3 Follow-Me](http://amzn.to/2fFO56B). All of these are great pressure
washers.
