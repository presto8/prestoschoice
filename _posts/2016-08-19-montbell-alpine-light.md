I have a bit of a puffer jacket addiction. I have owned as many as five puffers
at one time, down to three puffers now after I gave some away.

I love down jackets. They are extremely light, compressible, and very versatile
in adapting to the weather conditions. I think most people probably need at
least two puffer jackets, a heavy-duty one for extremely cold winter or
mountain conditions and a lighter one for summer camping and casual around-town
wear.

My hands-down favorite go-to puffer is the Montbell Alpine Light. Its styling
is not the most up-to-date, but my favorite feature is two cavernous drop-in
pockets inside the jacket.
