Presto’s Choice is a blog about all of the things I buy.

For almost everything I buy, whether it’s sunscreen, a Japanese toilet seat, or
a new car, I do a tremendous amount of product research. I strive for the best
value, which doesn’t necessarily mean the cheapest!

Because I do so much research, I thought I would do a little extra work to
document my findings so that others might benefit as well. My dream is that
users will trust my recommendations and make purchases solely based on my
recommendations!
