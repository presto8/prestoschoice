In my pre-kid days, lightweight mountaineering tents were all I was interested
in. Now, with two kids and all of the gear that goes with them, our family
needs demand an extremely large car-camping-style tent. For that purpose, the
Wenzel Sierra Pass is perfect! For about $100, you won't get aluminum poles or
really any fancy features, but the tent works, is easy to assemble, will keep
you dry, and has room for two queen-size air mattresses inside!

If money were no object, I would recommend the [REI Kingdom 6
Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/894016/rei-kingdom-6-tent) at $439. It isn't
any lighter, but you get a lot more flexibility, especially with the exterior
rain fly.
