Our family loves this 2-person inflatable raft. It comes with oars and a small
pump. The pump is not great, so we use an electric pump powered by the car
outlet, the [Intex Quick-Fill Electric Air Pump](http://amzn.to/2sidWLi).

One adult and two little kids can fit in this boat. But we ordered a second
boat so we can have one adult and one kid per boat.

There is a cheaper version of this boat available that doesn't include the oars
or the pump. Also, the price varies a lot on this product, use CamelCamelCamel
if you want to get a deal.
