Here are detailed notes about each component:

[Riotoro CR1080](http://amzn.to/2bhfQDs): This is a really great case. It is
the most compact case I could find that allows an ATX motherboard. It has a
two-sided design where the power supply and hard disks go on one side and the
motherboard goes on the other. To use this case, you will probably need to use
liquid cooling as there is not much height inside the case. Riotoro has
excellent customer service; I emailed them a fairly detailed question and they
responded within 1 business day with all of the information I needed. Overall,
highly recommended case, especially for the price.

A note on price: I linked Amazon out of convenience (because that is the
default vendor for Presto's Choice), but often Newegg has better prices.
