I decided that I didn't need a 4k monitor; the difference isn't really
noticeable from a few feet back and many current PCs don't support 4k.

I also knew that I wanted an IPS panel and 2560x1440 resolution. IPS panels
have much better brightness, viewing angles, and color fidelity versus the more
common and less expensive TFT panels.

I was pretty sure I wanted a 25" monitor. It seems like the perfect sweet spot
for productivity work, between 24" (too small) and 27" (too large). I
eventually plan to add a second identical monitor, which will give a combined
5120x1440 resolution.

The U2515H has really good reviews: [TFT Central](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/dell_u2515h.htm).

The U2515H has an excellent 3-year warranty and the "Premium Panel Guarantee"
will replace the monitor if it has a single stuck bright pixel. The U2515H is
one of the only monitors that is factory calibrated for color correctness.

I also own the [BenQ GW2765HT](http://amzn.to/2gdPUgz), which is also an IPS monitor but 27". It is a
nice monitor and a great value, but much less refined than the Dell. For
gaming, it is nice to have the bigger screen though.
