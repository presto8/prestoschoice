Abstract
========

Discusses how to design and build a multi-day emergency power solution, utilizing gas generators, lead-acid batteries, and power inverters.


Motivation
==========

Multi-day power outages, especially in the winter, can provide many challenges:
lighting, heating, bathing, food preparation and storage (especially frozen
items), communications, and boredom.


Review of available solutions
=============================
(It's safe to skip this section if you want to get straight to the recommendation)

Many options are available however cost is usually the main factor for most households.

Whole house standby generators powered by natural gas will provide automatic
failover. These require professional electrician installation as well as a
natural gas meter upgrade. The systems may require annual maintenance. The
natural gas pipes may rupture in a seismic event, defeating the entire
solution. Lastly, the cost is prohibitive for many at $15,000 or more.

Gas or propane generators are relatively inexpensive for the amount of power
they provide. Propane fuel is shelf-stable and readily available. Gas requires
treatment for storage and even then has a maximum shelf life of 2 years.
Generators require ventilation and must be run outside. Generators are quite
loud. Unused fuel should not be left in a generator. Generators produce power
by using an engine to turn an alternator that produces AC power. Unfortunately
the power produced is “rougher” than AC power from the power company, which may
cause problems for sensitive electronic devices.

Inverter generators are similar to regular generators but they solve two
problems: noise and AC power quality. Inverter generators are usually much
quieter than normal generators. Inverter generators produce power in a similar
way to regular generators, but they add an additional step where the AC power
is converted to DC and then back to AC again, which produces much cleaner AC
power. The downside to inverter generators is that they are substantially more
expensive than regular generators.


Minimum Recommended Solution
============================

I purchased all of these items from Amazon. The items often do go on sale or
can be purchased from Amazon Warehouse Deals for a substantial savings.
