When I first started backpacking, I got a MSR DragonFly. It is tough, can burn
anything, and is field serviceable. 

But then I noticed my friends using isobutane stoves that were burning and
boiling water with a lot less time and hassle. If you are only going camping a
few times a year, then just get the PocketRocket.

I don't own one, but Snow Peak makes very high quality products and the [Snow
Peak Giga Power Stove](http://amzn.to/2bGJtfs) is undoubtedly a good product.
